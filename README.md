## Charting Resources

This page is dedicated to documenting all the resources the Etterna community has available in 1 tidy place for new (and experienced) charters to access without needing to jump through any hoops.

This page is exclusively for Etterna-related resources

###Charting Editors

There are currently only 2 editors people in the community often use to make charts:

The first and most widely used is [ArrowVortex](https://arrowvortex.ddrnl.com/)
The second, clunkier editor that people use is [DDreamStudio](https://www.mediafire.com/file/82al94e5ot6sfy2/ds200BETA5.zip/file)

Both of these editors are viable, but it's widely recommended to start with ArrowVortex, and there's a lot more resources available for people who are learning to use ArrowVortex.
